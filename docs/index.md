Plasma, aka in French “Plateforme d’e-Learning pour l’Analyse de données Scientifiques MAssives”, aims at creating
an interactive tool to teach computational analysis of massive scientific data.
Plasma was born out of the need to offer a reproducible and high-performance analysis environment to our students.

Based on the Jupyter ecosystem, Plasma allows the creation and the management of isolated and highly customizable environments,
with an easy deployement on bare-metal servers or virtual machines.

Plasma utilizes [tljh-repo2docker](https://github.com/plasmabio/tljh-repo2docker),
a [repo2docker](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker) plugin for [The Littlest JupyterHub](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/) 1.0.
