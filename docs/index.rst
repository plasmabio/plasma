Plasma, aka in French “Plateforme d’eLearning pour l’Analyse de données Scientifiques MAssives”, aims at creating 
an interactive tool to teach computational analysis of massive scientific data. 
Plasma was born out of the need to offer a reproducible and high-performance analysis environment to our students.

Based on the Jupyter ecosystem, Plasma allows the creation and the management of isolated and highly customisable environments, 
with an easy deployement on bare-metal servers or virtual machines.

Plasma utilizes `tljh-repo2docker <https://github.com/plasmabio/tljh-repo2docker>`_, 
a `repo2docker <https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker>`_ plugin for `The Littlest JupyterHub <https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/>`_.
